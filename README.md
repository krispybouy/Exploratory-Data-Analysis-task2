# Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

In this task, I performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned Titanic dataset from Task 1.

## What I Did
- Generated summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for all numeric features.  
- Created histograms and boxplots to understand data distribution and detect outliers.  
- Used correlation matrix and pairplots to see how different features are related.  
- Looked for patterns and trends such as survival rates based on passenger class and gender.  
- Wrote a few short observations based on the visuals.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Key Observations
- Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival.  
- Females survived at a much higher rate than males.  
- Most passengers were in the 20–40 age range.  
- Fare values had a few clear outliers.  
- Fare and passenger class were strongly correlated.

The main goal of this task was to understand the dataset better through visuals and simple statistics before moving on to modeling.
